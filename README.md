What is hypothesis testing ?
	Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that is used in making statistical decisions using experimental data. Hypothesis Testing is basically an assumption that we make about   the population parameter.

why do we use it ?
	Hypothesis testing is an essential procedure in statistics. A hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best   supported by the sample data. When we say that a finding is statistically significant, it’s thanks to a hypothesis test.

what are basic of hypothesis ?
    the basic of hypothesis is normalisation and standard normalisation. all our
    hypothesis is revolve around basic of these 2 terms.
    
    Normal Distribution –A variable is said to be normally distributed or have a normal distribution if its distribution has the shape of a normal curve — a special bell-shaped curve. … The graph of a normal distribution is called the normal curve, which has all of the following properties: 1. The mean, median, and mode are equal.
    
Standardised Normal Distribution —A standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

Null hypothesis : In inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups. In other words it is a basic assumption or made based on domain or problem knowledge.

P-value :- The P value, or calculated probability, is the probability of finding the observed, or more extreme, results when the null hypothesis (H 0) of a study question is true — the definition of ‘extreme’ depends on how the hypothesis is being tested.

ANOVA (F-TEST) :- The t-test works well when dealing with two groups, but sometimes we want to compare more than two groups at the same time. For example, if we wanted to test whether voter age differs based on some categorical variable like race, we have to compare the means of each level or group the variable. We could carry out a separate t-test for each pair of groups, but when you conduct many tests you increase the chances of false positives. The analysis of variance or ANOVA is a statistical inference test that lets you compare multiple groups at the same time.
F = Between group variability / Within group variability
